# linked-lists
A library consisting of utility functions for linked lists.

For access to this library in your own code, simply place llutil.c an llutil.h where your compiler can 'see' them and write:

#include "llutil.h"

is a preprocessor directive in any source code that calls these functions.

Enjoy!
